# Alzheimers-Detection-using-EfficientNetB3
This project presents a deep learning-based system for early detection of Alzheimerâ€™s disease using brain MRI scans. Leveraging EfficientNetB3 with transfer learning and advanced preprocessing, the model accurately classifies images into four stages of dementia, providing a reliable, fast, and scalable tool to support clinical diagnosis.
